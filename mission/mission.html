      <h1>Mission Statement</h1>

      <h2>To Students</h2>
      <p>
        As a dedicated student committed to higher education, my mission is to persevere in pursuit of academic and personal growth, despite the challenges posed by ongoing budget cuts. Access to quality education should not be compromised, and I strive to remain engaged, resilient, and solution-driven. I will continue to advocate for myself and my peers, uplift student voices, and pursue my goals with integrity and determination, knowing that education is a pathway to opportunity and a right worth defending.
      </p>

      <h2>To Administration</h2>
      <p>
        As students, we remain committed to our education and the value of higher learning. However, the recent and proposed budget cuts have directly impacted our ability to succeed. We are already seeing the consequences—
        <strong>reduced access to classes, fewer available course sections, and the loss of valued lecturers who shape our academic experience.</strong>
        These changes are not just inconveniences—they are barriers to graduation, financial strain, and added emotional stress. Higher education should be a pathway forward, not a constant struggle to secure the resources we need to succeed. We urge the administration to stand with students, protect the integrity of our education, and make decisions that reflect the value of an inclusive, well-supported university community.
