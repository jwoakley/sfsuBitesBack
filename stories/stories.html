        <p>The budget cuts have impacted my ability to sign up for the classes I need to graduate. Looking into Fall, I'm already having issues signing up for class and will most likely delay my graduation. The budget cuts, is costing students more money and they are receiving less. At this point students might as well attend a private college. It will cost more but at least you will be able to attend the classes you need!</p>

        <p>My name is Andrew, I am a Visual Communications Design major, and by the end of this semester, I will be entering my last year here at San Francisco State. I had initially been preparing myself to just worry about the potential workload for my classes next year so I am able to graduate, but now with these unfair budget cuts, my path to graduation has become murkier and more expensive. Our education should not be marred with high costs and our paths to graduation becoming more difficult. Those two things for me have been the consequences of these budget cuts. I really would like to know what was in the heads of the higher-ups or whoever the people were behind this decision despite having plenty enough money for themselves.</p>

        <p> Budget cuts have made it nearly impossible to stay on track. Classes are being canceled, lack of online and evening options, and waitlists are overloaded. What’s most frustrating is the lack of support and real transparency from the administration. Emails go unanswered, decisions are unclear, and students are left to navigate the chaos alone. I’ve considered leaving—not because I’ve given up, but because the support we need isn’t there. We are the students, and the quality of our learning should be the top priority.</p>

        <p>Without the necessary classes and support, my ability to graduate on time has been extremely difficult. My expected time to graduate was originally SPRING 2025 and now has been pushed to SPRING 2027. It is beyond disappointing having put so much effort into my studies only to feel like SFSU does not put any effort into their students. I feel neglected and unmotivated to continue university after SFSU's budget cuts. It is unfair to cut classes and fire the knowledgeable and dedicated professors that we currently have; only to be replaced by professors who don't know about design. San Francisco State University needs to do better.</p>

        <p>Because of recent budget cuts, I have experienced tighter schedules where I have to sacrifice necessities such as lunch so that I can reach the units I require to graduate in 4 years. Something I wish decision-makers understood is that the quality of education is what truly matters in an institution, and that it does not come down to how many students are receiving an education, but how well these students are doing mentally and academically. Because of these cuts, it's hard to feel encouraged to continue, and it feels easier to give up, since the institution that is supposed to support you is constantly making things harder, and a successful future seems distant.</p>

        <p>Going to college has been incredibly challenging for me, especially since I’ve been in school much longer than the typical four-year timeline. I've had to drop classes simply because I couldn't afford the rising tuition costs. At the same time, the quality of my education has declined—teachers and staff are being cut, classes are harder to access, and the overall support feels weaker. It often feels like the system is designed to keep us enrolled longer just to squeeze more money out of us. It's as if they don't want us to receive an education.</p>

      <p>What hurts most about these changes is that it is affecting everyone, delaying graduation, and increasing stress among my peers. Delayed graduation leads to a delay in students entering the workforce, adding stress to their finances on top of the stress of their current classes. Without necessary classes and support, my ability to graduate on time has been delayed as I cannot get into the classes I need.</p>

      <p>My name is Michael, and I am majoring in Visual Communications Design. From what the budget cuts are doing, it ruins the quality of the classes being taught. I think for me, my fear of these budget cuts has some ripple effects, and with those effects, it could be the beginning of an end for some of the departments, eventually shutting down departments, just like what they did to some of the sports departments.</p>

      <p>I am already taking an extra year and a half! I literally cannot afford to take more time to graduate!

They are taking money we didn't get to make yet.</p>
